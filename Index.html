                    A significant temperature rise has been observed since pre-industrial times due to human actions and degradation of the environment. Regarding Earth’s future, different pathways have been projected.
                    </br>
                    Think about the climate at intermediate temperature rises; the effects of global warming that are already visible.
                    Now, consider that Earth is a complex ecosystem whose processes affect each other.
                    What if these processes entered a state of continuous mutual influence causing higher temperature rises, even if human emissions were reduced?
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Meet our tipping point - the threshold for abrupt and irreversible change.
