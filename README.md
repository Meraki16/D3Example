# THE POINT OF NO RETURN

Project developed on the context of the course _Beyond Heatmaps: Data Visualization for a Warming Planet_ offered at Hochschule für Künste Bremen by Moritz Stefaner in Winter Semester 18/19.

In this course we attempted to explore new ways to visualize climate change data with the intention of making it more understandable. Our group focused on the concepts presented on the paper [“Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene”](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326876618_Trajectories_of_the_Earth_System_in_the_Anthropocene). Our plan was to investigate the concept of tipping points in order to show the impacts of biogeophysical feedbacks on the earth’s future possible pathways. The paper claims that global warming triggers biogeophysical processes on earth that affect each other leading to a higher global average temperature than expected even if emissions are reduced. When reaching a tipping point (the first is assumed to be at 1°C), the mutual reinforcement of processes reaches a climax resulting in an unexpected jump in temperature. After a tipping point is met, it is unlikely that changes can be reversed.

This project shows a comparison between two possible scenarios (hot house vs. stabilized earth pathway) while focusing on the impacts a hot house scenario can have on the Earth's future.
